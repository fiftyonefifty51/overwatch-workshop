# Description

My good buddy kuzirh and I are working on making custom maps that we can play in-between losing games in Overwatch. The project is meant to be useful for anyone that is looking to get their feet wet in the workshop editor. The idea came from playing the different community gamemodes in Overwatch waiting for a queue to pop and wanting to modify them to make them even more fun.

# OverPy

We are making use of the OverPy extension within VS Code to take the Settings scripts from the workshop editor and decompile them down to a pythonic language for deeper customizations. Once modifications are complete, one can use the OverPy compilation tool to compile the code back to the C-style settings script that Overwatch is expecting.

# More to come!

Take a look around and check out the workshop editor [here](https://workshop.codes/) for more community made maps. Also, be on the lookout for all the juicy maps we having cooking up in the lab.
